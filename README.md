## Description
This package was created for lazy people like me. The package concept was simple, to write well-tuned generators for different occasions.
For example: **Package.random(x)** - works on the basis of the **crypto** package.  
## Usage

    // import { rand, random } from "@dmaksimyk/randoms"; // ES6+
    // const { rand, random } = require("@dmaksimyk/randoms"); // ES5 and below
	
	rand(1,23); // rand(x, y)
	random(100); // random(x)
## Typescript
TypeScript support out of the box.
